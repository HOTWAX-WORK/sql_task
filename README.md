### 3 Products Missing NetSuite ID

**Business Problem:**  
A product cannot sync to NetSuite unless it has a valid NetSuite ID. The OMS needs a list of all products that still need to be created or updated in NetSuite.

**Fields to Retrieve:**  
- `PRODUCT_ID`  
- `INTERNAL_NAME`  
- `PRODUCT_TYPE_ID`  
- `NETSUITE_ID` (or similar field indicating the NetSuite ID; may be `NULL` or empty if missing)

```
select p.PRODUCT_ID, p.INTERNAL_NAME , p.PRODUCT_TYPE_ID , gi.ID_VALUE  from product p
join good_identification gi on p.PRODUCT_ID = gi.PRODUCT_ID 
and gi.GOOD_IDENTIFICATION_TYPE_ID = 'ERP_ID' and gi.ID_VALUE  is null;
```

### 5.3 Top-Selling Product in New York

**Business Problem:**  
Merchandising teams need to identify the best-selling product(s) in a specific region (New York) for targeted restocking or promotions.

**Fields to Retrieve:**  
- `PRODUCT_ID`  
- `INTERNAL_NAME`
- `TOTAL_QUANTITY_SOLD`  
- `CITY` / `STATE` (within New York region) 
- `REVENUE` (optionally, total sales amount)

```
select
	p.PRODUCT_ID ,
	p.INTERNAL_NAME,
	sum(oi.QUANTITY),
	sum(oi.UNIT_PRICE * oi.QUANTITY) AS TOTAL REVENUE,
	pa.CITY ,
	pa.STATE_PROVINCE_GEO_ID
from
	order_item oi
join order_contact_mech ocm on
	ocm.ORDER_ID = oi.ORDER_ID and OCM.CONTACT_MECH_PURPOSE_TYPE_ID like '%LOCATION'
join postal_address pa on
	pa.CONTACT_MECH_ID = ocm.CONTACT_MECH_ID
	and pa.STATE_PROVINCE_GEO_ID = 'NY'
join product p on
	p.PRODUCT_ID = oi.PRODUCT_ID
group by
	p.PRODUCT_ID,
	pa.city,
	pa.STATE_PROVINCE_GEO_ID
having
	SUM(oi.QUANTITY) = (
	select
		MAX(total_quantity)
	from
		(
		select
			SUM(oi2.QUANTITY) as total_quantity,
			pa2.CITY
		from
			order_item oi2
		join order_contact_mech ocm2 on
			ocm2.ORDER_ID = oi2.ORDER_ID
		join postal_address pa2 on
			pa2.CONTACT_MECH_ID = ocm2.CONTACT_MECH_ID
		where
			pa2.STATE_PROVINCE_GEO_ID = 'NY'
		group by
			pa2.CITY,
			oi2.PRODUCT_ID
    ) as city_sales
	where
		city_sales.CITY = pa.CITY
)
```

EXPLANATION
The query starts with the order_item table because it contains details about products sold, including PRODUCT_ID, QUANTITY, and UNIT_PRICE.Next, 
order_contact_mech is joined to link orders to their shipping addresses.The postal_address table is then joined to retrieve location details such 
as CITY and STATE_PROVINCE_GEO_ID. The query filters for STATE_PROVINCE_GEO_ID = 'NY' to ensure that only orders from New York are considered. 
Yhe product table is also joined to obtain product-related details, specifically PRODUCT_ID and INTERNAL_NAME. Aggregations are performed to compute TOTAL_QUANTITY_SOLD and REVENUE. A subquery determines the maximum quantity sold in each city, and the HAVING clause ensures only the 
top-selling product per city is returned.
